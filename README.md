##Synopsis

Credit card fraud is an inclusive term for fraud committed using a payment card, such as a credit card or debit card. This means a fraud when someone uses your credit card or credit account to make a purchase you didn't authorize. This activity can happen in different ways: If you lose your credit card or have it stolen, it can be used to make purchases or other transactions, either in person or online. 
 
It is important that credit card companies be able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase. Thus we build a machine learning model to predict whether an anonymized credit card transactions is labeled as fraudulent or genuine. 

Worked on R on a highly unbalanced Kaggle dataset. Modeled the balanced data (SMOTE) to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions with 99% accuracy using KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Neural Network techniques.
